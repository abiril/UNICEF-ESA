## Under Construction!

I will lay out the work I have done, signpost to interesting things, and how to run the main models.

This will be linked to the paper in progress: 'Modelling Priority Areas for Improving Global School Access: A Geostatistical Machine Learning Approach'

Improving access to quality, modern education is a key target of the United Nations' 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. However, a major challenge in measuring progress towards this goal is the lack of high-quality, global development-related datasets, particularly in low- and lower-middle income countries. The current approaches commonly use very high-resolution satellite imagery to identify unknown school buildings by building classification and computer vision methods. The aim of this work is to use coarser gridded, global satellite data products to identify key regions of interest and create a data-driven priority search method for smaller, subnational areas. The proposed approach uses statistical approaches to geospatial Random Forest (RF) models, utilising the speed and flexibility of RF, along with the introduction of spatial autocorrelation structures and spatial predictive performance.
